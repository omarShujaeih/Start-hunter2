Star Hunter (Serious Game)
1. Project Overview

This project is an extension of the Star Hunter game developed in Phase One.
In Phase Two, the game was modified into a serious educational game that focuses on improving the player’s basic mathematical and logical thinking skills.

The player is required to solve a simple mathematical equation and use the result to predict the position where a star will fall. The game combines learning with real-time interaction and time pressure.

  
  
  
  2. Chosen Learning Skill

The main learning skill targeted in this project is:

Basic arithmetic and logical reasoning

Specifically:

Addition and subtraction at early levels

Multiplication and division at higher levels

Interpreting the result of an equation and making a decision based on it

The player must mentally solve the equation before acting, which encourages active thinking rather than random movement.

  
  
  3. How Gameplay Supports Learning



The learning process is directly integrated into the gameplay:

An equation is displayed on the screen.

The player has a limited thinking time to solve it.

Based on the result, the player predicts the correct column where the star will fall.

After the thinking time ends, the player’s movement is locked.

The star falls according to the correct answer.

This design forces the player to:

Read the equation carefully

Solve it mentally

Make a correct decision under time pressure

Mistakes result in penalties, while correct answers are rewarded, reinforcing the learning objective.

  
  
  4. Game Rules and Mechanics



Controls:

Left / Right Arrow or A / D: Move player (only during thinking time)

Space: Pause / Resume the game

R: Restart the game

Mouse click: Start and Restart buttons

Game Mechanics:

The player can move only during the thinking phase.

Once the timer ends, movement is frozen.

The same equation is repeated if the player fails.

A new equation is generated only after a successful attempt.

     
     
     
     
     5. Win and Lose Conditions


Win Condition:

The player wins by reaching a target score.

Lose Condition:

The player loses when all lives are depleted.

Rewards and Penalties:

Correct answer: Gain points

Incorrect answer or missed star: Lose points and a life

Bonus action when reaching a certain score (increased difficulty and bonus points)



6. Motivation and Engagement Elements



To keep the player engaged, the game includes:

Score system

Lives system

Increasing difficulty level

Visual feedback and animations

Sound effects for success and failure

Pause and restart options for better control

These elements encourage replayability and sustained engagement while maintaining the educational goal.



7. Technical Implementation



The entire game is implemented using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

The code is modular, with each game component implemented in a separate class.

All user interface elements (buttons, score, timer, messages) are rendered inside the canvas.

The project follows a clear structure separating game logic, input handling, and rendering.



8. Conclusion

This project successfully transforms a simple arcade-style game into a serious educational game. By combining mathematical problem-solving with interactive gameplay and time-based challenges, the game achieves its learning objective while remaining engaging and enjoyable for the player.
